# autobump

[简体中文](autobump.zh.md)

Bumps the new versions nvchecker reports.

## How it works

1. nvchecker finds a new version and opens an issue.
2. The engine decides whether the bump is purely mechanical: a version change only, or
   something that needs dependencies, USE flags or patches touched.
3. If it is mechanical, it changes the version, regenerates the Manifest and runs a real
   emerge in the CI container.
4. Only a passing emerge opens a PR. That PR still goes through `emerge-on-pr` and
   `pkgcheck`, and a human reviews and merges it.

Step 2 has three outcomes:

* **mechanical** — version change only and emerge passed, so it opens a PR.
* **escalate** — major version jump, changed dependencies, or a `files/` patch to
  re-verify. It comments the evidence on the issue, uploads the engine's evidence
  directory as a run artifact, and opens no PR.
* **defer** — a transient network, mirror or upstream-file problem, a per-version
  vendor bundle that is not generated yet, or a heavy dependency with no binpkg on
  the binhost that would exceed the CI timeout. Retried
  automatically.

## Which packages to opt in

Suitable:

* `-bin` packages, where a bump is just a different tarball.
* Single-file source packages with no vendored dependencies.
* rust or npm packages whose vendor bundle is stable.

Not suitable:

* Packages whose dependencies change between versions.
* Packages carrying `files/` patches, because every patch has to be re-verified.
* Packages needing a vendor bundle generated per version.

When in doubt, build-test first: Actions → autobump-trial → Run workflow, with `targets`
set to nvchecker issue numbers separated by spaces. Each target gets a real bump, emerge,
install and pkgcheck in the CI container and reports PASS or FAIL, without opening a PR.

The `autobump-recommend` workflow collects packages that look mechanically bumpable but
are not opted in into one issue, which is a good place to pick from. It only recommends;
nothing is enabled automatically.

## Opting in and out

Add `autobump = true` to the package in
[`.github/workflows/overlay.toml`](../.github/workflows/overlay.toml):

```toml
["net-proxy/mihomo"]
source = "github"
github = "MetaCubeX/mihomo"
autobump = true          # add to enable, remove to disable
```

Packages without the line are never bumped, so removing it is how you stop one that
keeps opening bad PRs.

The value of `autobump` also says how many old versions to keep: `true` replaces, `N` keeps the
N most recent, `"all"` keeps every one.

## Packages whose SRC_URI depends on an ebuild variable

`app-editors/cursor` builds `SRC_URI` from `MY_COMMIT`, so a version-only copy fetches nothing.
One regex makes autobump replace that variable after it copies the ebuild and before it
regenerates the Manifest:

```toml
["app-editors/cursor"]
source = "regex"
url = "https://cursor.com/api/download?platform=linux-x64&releaseTrack=latest"
regex = '"version":"([\d.]+)"'
autobump = true
autobump_my_commit_regex = '"commitSha":"([0-9a-f]{40})"'
```

The `my_commit` in the key is `MY_COMMIT`, the value is capture group 1, and the document
defaults to the entry's own `url`. Both accept `${PV}`, replaced with the version being bumped
to:

```toml
autobump_my_build_regex = '"version":"${PV}","execution_id":"([0-9]+)"'
autobump_my_build_url = "https://example.org/releases/${PV}"
```

Write the regex as a TOML literal (single-quoted) string. If the document cannot be fetched, the
regex does not match, or the value equals the current one, nothing is rewritten and nothing is
bumped.

## Running it

It runs 5 minutes after each nvchecker run finishes, once the issues are filed, and daily
at 11:00 UTC as a backstop.

### Web

[Actions → autobump → Run workflow](https://github.com/gentoo-zh/overlay/actions/workflows/autobump.yml)

### With gh

```bash
# every open nvchecker issue
gh workflow run autobump.yml --repo gentoo-zh/overlay

# only these issues, space separated
gh workflow run autobump.yml --repo gentoo-zh/overlay -f issues="11855 11860"

# change the cap for this run
gh workflow run autobump.yml --repo gentoo-zh/overlay -f limit=20
```

Both take the same inputs; `issues` accepts digits and spaces only.

The workers run in an image built once a day (`autobump-env`). `rebuild_env` forces a fresh
one; `env_date` runs on an earlier day's image, of which the last three are kept.

`limit` caps engine attempts across the whole run; it defaults to 0, which runs the whole
queue. The planner resolves the queue against the cached state and assigns those attempts to
disjoint shards; skips are free.

A run has three phases: plan, at most eight bump workers in parallel, and collect. Each worker
lasts at most 360 minutes and GitHub cancels it there. Each package has a separate two-hour
ceiling: `ebuild install`, `emerge` and `ebuild unpack` are deferred on timeout and retried next
run.

Locally, clone the engine into the overlay root, install `dev-lang/ruby`, then run:

```bash
AUTOBUMP_ENGINE='ruby autobump-rb/bin/autobump' \
    python3 scripts/autobump-sweep.py [issue#...] [--limit N] [--pr]
```

Which issues a run processed and how each came out is in the sweep summary at the end of
that Actions run log.
